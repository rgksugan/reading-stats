The pieces where the author speaks about the society in general and not about the ruling family.<br/><br/>There were chapters where the author gets more technical about the time the queen left for her summer vacation which I don't think anyone will be interested today.<br/><br/>And another major issue I personally found with the book is I felt the book is written from the point of view of the ruler and not from the common man.

The book is about Gipsies, people who are nomads. He tries to get the stories of nomads from TamilNadu and how their current lives are. This is a very small book for a full-blown research text. But the author has strategically mentioned where to find more text on this subject and also people who are actively researching about them.<br/><br/>The book has two tracks of storytelling. One of them is authors experience in Varanasi and the other about meeting nomads across Tamil Nadu. The author has subtly argued how Buddha was the first nomad he knew to LTTE Prabhakaran is also a nomad.<br/><br/>Authors thoughts are towards left politics and he also mentions how he believes in God but not the nonsense around it.<br/><br/>It actually made me realise how less we think about people whom we meet in our everyday life. I have met almost all the nomads he has written about in my real life and I never gave a second thought about them at all.<br/><br/>The author sure loves to travel, music and reading. The book is filled with recommendations of music he liked and the authors and books he enjoyed. Very interesting short read.",,,1,,Novel  Review,0,,,,,

There are chapters which I felt like I want to be just done with it and there are chapters which gave me goosebumps. Probably making the book a few chapters less would have made the book even better. That being said the book is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is not the first history book I am reading. But this book is unique in the way that the author decided to present the facts. Its a work of fiction with history sprinkled in. So it's up to you to believe in what you want. That's a nice move from the author especially with authors like Perumal Murugan getting into trouble for their books.<br/><br/>The author made me fall in love with Madurai. How much it has changed in all these centuries. The best thing I loved about this book is how history is mostly not about the rulers of the place but about the people of the place. I can't stop comparing it with Ivory Throne the last history I book I had read which speaks all about the rulers of Travancore but very rarely about their subjects.<br/><br/>This book gives a lot of things to ponder upon. For instance, there is a scene where an old lady narrates to the youngsters of her village how she had asked for what's called a modern-day divorce because of her husbands impotency and how she had married thrice and found the love of her life. I don't think in today's Indian society its possible to marry thrice and live life without being looked down by others.<br/><br/>Be it the cover image, be it the scene where the Madurai fort is broken down the author was done some extensive research. After reading this book my look on South Tamil society is never going to be the same.<br/><br/>The book mentions a lot of small villages and places in and around Madurai. It would be better to arrange a Kaval Kottam tour like the already existing Ponninyin Selvan tour. Would love to know the places.<br/><br/>There were some words which I didn't understand. For instance the word mallu vetti. Google still is not so good in vernacular languages to give the right response to these words. So I had to move with my assumptions of meanings for that word. Have to buy a Tamil dictionary soon.<br/><br/>Overall the book is a must read if you want to understand the life of Mukulathor folks around Madurai. I am not from this caste and my respect for them has increased multifold after reading this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The book won Sahitya Academy award in 1973. Today in 2018, when the current generation would have never heard of Sarvodhya or completely believes in some random message about Gandhi from a piece of information shared in the social media, not everyone will enjoy the book.<br/><br/>The book coveys message on Gandhian values, feminism, democracy vs socialist thoughts, environmental awareness, philosophy etc. Interestingly feminism in 1973 has changed a lot from what it is today.<br/><br/>The book is written in a period where the first generation Gandhian politicians are almost done with their ruling and the new generation of politicians who didn't have any motive to serve the people are coming to power. The book shows the anger of a woman who follows Gandhian values all her life and also the struggle she faces with the materialistic world around her.",,,1,,,1,2018/03/18,Amazon,unspecified,,

I had heard that this essay is so convincing. One of the judges reportedly said that if the audience were the jury, they would have acquitted Godse. So I started this book with all my enthusiasm and open-mindedness humanly possible. But the book turned out to be a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Gandhi was an idealist and not so pragmatic in his philosophies, this much I can agree with him.

The essay is a masterpiece. I have never highlighted so many times in such a small book. Exclude the appendix and the introduction and the main essay is well thought through. In the introduction, Ambedkar speaks about why the speech was not delivered and in the appendix, he gives his reply to Gandhi's reply to this essay.<br/><br/>I felt the book is bit outdated since the social-political landscape of the country has changed a lot since the book was written. Still, we have a long road to go to abolish caste from India. And sadly no current politician is speaking about this anymore.
