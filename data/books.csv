When I grew up in my village, பொங்கல் was the most celebrated festival. To be frank I don't remember celebrating Diwali or New Year. His essay on Pongal confirms it.<br/>""சேனை, சேம்பு, கருணை, சிறுகிழங்கு, பனங்கிழங்கு ஆகிய மண்ணுக்கு அடியில் விளையக்கூடிய கிழங்கு வகைகள் பொங்கலுக்குப் படைக்கப்படுபவை. இவை உயர் சாதியினர் எனச் சொல்லப்படுபவர்களால் விலக்கப்பட்டவை. இன்றும் இவை பெருங்கோயில்களில் பயன்படுத்தப்படவில்லை என்பதை நாம் கவனத்தில் கொள்ள வேண்டும். இதுவே பொங்கல் எளிய மக்களின் இனிய கொண்டாட்டம் என்பதற்குச் சாட்சி.""<br/>4. This is another tradition not many knows of. Pongal around the corner, thanks to Tho. Pa, now I know the reason behind it.<br/>""தைப் பொங்கலையடுத்த மறுநாள் (கரிநாள் என்பது மக்கள் வழக்கு; ‘கனு’ என்பது மேலோர் மரபு) ஊரிலுள்ள மக்கள் சாதி, மத வேறுபாடின்றிக் காட்டுப் பகுதியில் வேட்டைக்குச் சென்று முயல், உடும்பு, காட்டுக்கோழி, கவுதாரி போன்றவற்றை வேட்டையாடி ஊருக்குள் கொண்டுவந்து ஊர் நடுவில் இறைச்சியைப் பகிர்ந்து எடுத்துக்கொள்கிறார்கள். ஊர்் மந்தை ‘மன்றம்’ ஆக மாற்றம் பெற்று வளர்ந்த கதையின் ஒரு பகுதி இது.""<br/>5. ""பகிர்ந்துண்ணும் கலாசாரம் இந்நாட்டுத் தொல்குடி மக்களிடம் அரும்பிய வெளிப்பாடாகும். மேலோர் மரபு பேசும் சனாதான தருமம், மக்கள் கூடியும் கலந்தும் உண்ணும் வழக்கத்தைத் தடை செய்தது என்பதே வரலாற்றுண்மையாகும்."" - These lines reminded me of again another childhood memory where all the kids in the street used to sit together and eat in the street.

There are chapters which I felt like I want to be just done with it and there are chapters which gave me goosebumps. Probably making the book a few chapters less would have made the book even better. That being said the book is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is not the first history book I am reading. But this book is unique in the way that the author decided to present the facts. Its a work of fiction with history sprinkled in. So it's up to you to believe in what you want. That's a nice move from the author especially with authors like Perumal Murugan getting into trouble for their books.<br/><br/>The author made me fall in love with Madurai. How much it has changed in all these centuries. The best thing I loved about this book is how history is mostly not about the rulers of the place but about the people of the place. I can't stop comparing it with Ivory Throne the last history I book I had read which speaks all about the rulers of Travancore but very rarely about their subjects.<br/><br/>This book gives a lot of things to ponder upon. For instance, there is a scene where an old lady narrates to the youngsters of her village how she had asked for what's called a modern-day divorce because of her husbands impotency and how she had married thrice and found the love of her life. I don't think in today's Indian society its possible to marry thrice and live life without being looked down by others.<br/><br/>Be it the cover image, be it the scene where the Madurai fort is broken down the author was done some extensive research. After reading this book my look on South Tamil society is never going to be the same.<br/><br/>The book mentions a lot of small villages and places in and around Madurai. It would be better to arrange a Kaval Kottam tour like the already existing Ponninyin Selvan tour. Would love to know the places.<br/><br/>There were some words which I didn't understand. For instance the word mallu vetti. Google still is not so good in vernacular languages to give the right response to these words. So I had to move with my assumptions of meanings for that word. Have to buy a Tamil dictionary soon.<br/><br/>Overall the book is a must read if you want to understand the life of Mukulathor folks around Madurai. I am not from this caste and my respect for them has increased multifold after reading this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Today in 2018, when the current generation would have never heard of Sarvodhya or completely believes in some random message about Gandhi from a piece of information shared in the social media, not everyone will enjoy the book.<br/><br/>The book coveys message on Gandhian values, feminism, democracy vs socialist thoughts, environmental awareness, philosophy etc. Interestingly feminism in 1973 has changed a lot from what it is today.<br/><br/>The book is written in a period where the first generation Gandhian politicians are almost done with their ruling and the new generation of politicians who didn't have any motive to serve the people are coming to power. The book shows the anger of a woman who follows Gandhian values all her life and also the struggle she faces with the materialistic world around her.",,,1,,,1,2018/03/18,Amazon,unspecified,,

The book is about Gipsies, people who are nomads. He tries to get the stories of nomads from TamilNadu and how their current lives are. This is a very small book for a full-blown research text. But the author has strategically mentioned where to find more text on this subject and also people who are actively researching about them.<br/><br/>The book has two tracks of storytelling. One of them is authors experience in Varanasi and the other about meeting nomads across Tamil Nadu. The author has subtly argued how Buddha was the first nomad he knew to LTTE Prabhakaran is also a nomad.<br/><br/>Authors thoughts are towards left politics and he also mentions how he believes in God but not the nonsense around it.<br/><br/>It actually made me realise how less we think about people whom we meet in our everyday life. I have met almost all the nomads he has written about in my real life and I never gave a second thought about them at all.<br/><br/>The author sure loves to travel, music and reading.

When she explains scenes, she gives more details about those scenes, which makes the book more interesting. Personally I as an Indian feels few things could never happen in India. Like the toilet cleaner offering her a hand job etc.<br/><br/>After reading the first few chapters, I was thinking how mean the author is to say bad things about my motherland.
